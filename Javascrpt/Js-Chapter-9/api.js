// Fetch API
// The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching (sending/receiving) resources (including across the network).
// It uses Request and Response objects.
// The fetch() method is used to request a resource.

// let promise = fetch(url, [options]);

// Understanding Terms
// AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
// JSON: JavaScript Object Notation

// json() method: returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON. (INPUT is JSON, output is JS object)

// Request & Response
// HTTP Verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
// Response Status Code  (we can read from mdn)
// HTTP response headers also contain details about the response, such as content type, HTTP status code etc.
